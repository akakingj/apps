# Changelog

## Cluster Redline 0.8.3

- Add orange Cluster renderer installation guidance in English and Korean.
- Fix the requested refresh ceiling at 20fps and remove its settings selector.
- Ignore saved legacy frame rates and retain other settings and acquisition behavior.
- Update screen layout and both SDK-free Store language templates. Actual sustained frame rate remains car-dependent.

## Cluster Redline 0.8.2

- Defer initial image visibility until queued pixels reach the ordered socket; cancel late visibility on hide/drop.
- Keep map acquisition requests alive while parked; test backpressure, delayed acquisition and cancellation.
- Tell map-target users to select Map view or Off; preserve front-center guidance.
- Include a read-only Windows SSH log collector. Native DCSM retry timing and Assist priority remain unchanged.

## Cluster Redline 0.8.1

- Match the Live Data header: title and Basic/Advanced tabs in one strip.
- Use a plain black list, thin dividers, M color strip and subtle red selection.
- Keep orange setup guidance, setting behavior and native bar fallback controls.

## Cluster Redline 0.8.0

- Add Basic/Advanced settings tabs and an orange Central display area Off instruction.
- Add a persisted output-worker switch, Sport/all-mode selection and Petrol/Diesel/eDrive/M display presets.
- Convert power/torque values, peaks and scales for PS/kW and Nm/kgf·m.
- Retire manual gearbox prefixes and RPM/torque/power scales; use received programmes and preset scales.
- Preserve legacy OFF and shift settings, shut down late subscriptions, and keep native RHMI controls.
- Document ongoing stock-map/Assisted Driving View overlay investigation; no claimed fix for scene priority.

## 1.3.1

- Cluster Redline 0.4.1: G20 330i petrol scale maximum 7000 rpm and red zone from 6000 rpm.
- Keep the shift alert independent of the red-zone start, and color filled red-zone segments red.
- Preserve saved custom settings and the diesel/hybrid presets.

## 1.3.0

- Cluster Redline 0.4.0 fixes the ignored 2000 rpm setting for petrol/hybrid profiles.
- Turn RPM digits red at the configured threshold; match M Tricolour styling and show real gear.
- Remove the cluster title and shift footer.
- Give Sport content precedence over lower map layers and report target holder/state.
- Discover renderer metadata in both deployed layouts and distinguish 0.3.1 from 0.3.10.
- Include a read-only-by-default renderer diagnostic with explicit reversible takeover setup in normal kits.

## 1.2.0

- Use the normal upstream build, --language ko, make-car-kit and push-to-car workflow.
- Make Cluster Redline 0.3.0 English by default, with Korean in the shared catalog.
- Preserve explicit autostart metadata through the standard builder and installer.
- Check cluster-render requirements before the cluster app is installed.
- Retain the normal backup/restore flow and manual startup for existing apps.
- Test the standard installer functions on a temporary OAP tree and build all 17 apps together.
- Retire the separate private-ZIP installer path.

## 1.1.0

- Place Cluster Redline 0.2.1 directly in apps/cluster_redline alongside Circuit.
- Separate English and Korean guides for both apps; make the root README an app index.
- Translate Cluster Redline renderer choices, mode and layer status labels.
- Build both Korean apps into one private kit, or select a single app.
- Preserve Circuit's manual startup and Cluster Redline's autostart metadata.
- Verify every selected artifact before sequential installation; ignore stray old bundles.
- Add combined-kit and isolated single-app release tests. No real-vehicle validation yet.

## 1.0.0

- Initial public source release.
- 30 deterministic puzzle levels.
- Touch, iDrive controller and software-renderer fallback controls.
